Project Title: Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression
Overview:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their services, is a critical business concern for companies in various industries, including telecom. By identifying potential churners early, companies can take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

Key Features:
Logistic Regression Model: We use logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to predict customer churn based on various features such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type.
Evaluation Metrics Beyond Accuracy: In addition to accuracy, we evaluate our model's performance using metrics like sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness.
Optimal Cutoff Point: We determine the optimal cutoff probability threshold for classification by analyzing the ROC curve, ensuring a balance between sensitivity and specificity.
GitHub Repository Structure: The repository contains well-organized code files, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction on the test set. It also includes Jupyter Notebooks for easy replication and exploration of the analysis.
Technologies Used:
Python
NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation and visualization
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis and documentation
Usage:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the Jupyter Notebooks sequentially to understand the data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Customize the model parameters and features as per your requirements.
Future Enhancements:
Integration of additional machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for comparison and ensemble modeling.
Deployment of the model as a web service or application for real-time predictions.
Continuous monitoring and updating of the model with new data to improve performance over time.
